# Snake
Simple classic Snake written in Python in which you may either play or watch the game being played by bot.
Bot's algorithm generates Hamilton's cycle - a path that goes through each field exactly once and ends where it started - on the game board and checks if the snake can take a shortcut on it's path (the condition is that the snake must be shorter than a number of skipped fields). The bot's winning chance is 100%.
